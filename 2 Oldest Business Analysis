-- Begin Analysis

-- Selecting the oldest and newest founding years from the businesses table

SELECT
MAX(year_founded) AS Oldest,
MIN(year_founded) AS Youngest
FROM businesses;

-- Getting the count of rows in businesses where the founding year was before 1000

SELECT 
COUNT(business)
FROM businesses
WHERE year_founded < 1000

-- Selecting all columns from businesses where the founding year was before 1000
-- Arranging the results from oldest to newest

SELECT *
FROM businesses
WHERE year_founded < 1000
ORDER BY year_founded;

-- Selecting business name, founding year, and country code from businesses; and category from categories
-- Filtering for founding year before 1000
-- Arranging from oldest to newest

SELECT
b.business,
b.year_founded,
b.country_code,
c.category
FROM businesses as B
INNER JOIN categories as C
ON b.category_code = c.category_code
WHERE year_founded < 1000
ORDER BY year_founded;

-- Selecting the category and count of category (as "n")
-- Arranging by descending count, limited to 10 most common categories

SELECT
c.category,
COUNT(c.category) as n
FROM businesses as b
INNER JOIN categories as c
ON b.category_code  =  c.category_code
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY n DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Selecting the oldest founding year (as "oldest") from businesses, 
-- and continent from countries
-- for each continent, ordered from oldest to newest 

SELECT

co.continent
FROM businesses as b
INNER JOIN countries as co
ON b.country_code = co.country_code
GROUP BY continent
