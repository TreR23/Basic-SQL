# SQL-Files
This repository contains various SQL projects I've worked on starting with the basics and proceeding to more advanced and complex inquiries. 

1. Golden Age of Video Games

In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data. I joined datasets and compared results with set theory. I also filtered, grouped, and ordered data. 

2. Oldest Business Analysis

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

3. International Debt Statistics

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

I found the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

4. Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process. In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools. I looked at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city.

5. Analyzing American Baby Name Trends

What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes. Skills utilized included: ranking, grouping, joining, ordering, and pattern matching.

6. Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue

Sports clothing is a booming sector. I used SQL to analyze product data for an online sports retail company. I worked with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic. I also utilized techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue.
